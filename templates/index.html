<h1>Boulder Canyon Climbing Crags Byte 1</h1>
<p>When deciding where climb, climbers typically reference books that detail all the climbs in an area.
In areas with large numbers of climbs, it can be difficult to decide on a climbing area (crag).</p>
<p>Although these books contain significant information about the climbs, they include vague location
 references (such as "by the no camping sign"), making it difficult to find a desired crag.</p>
<p>In addition to location, climbers have to make decisions about the type of climbing they (as a group) want to do. 
They have to conside the type, difficulty, and quality of climbing.</p>
<p>To help climbers make better decisions about where they should climb, I was interested in answering the following question:</p>
<h2>"How are different types of climbs geographically distributed in Boulder Canyon?"</h2>
<h3>Trad/Sport Classification</h3>
<p>Crags are classified on this map according to whether they have predominantly "traditional" or "sport" climbs.</p>
<p>These climbing styles require different gear, so knowing what a crag has to offer can help somebody plan ahead.
The details of the climbing area are reference within each location marker.</p>

<h3>Difficulty of Climbs at Crag</h3>
<p>Crags are classified on this map according to the predominant grade, or difficulty, of the climb.</p>
<p> Green means the areas has
predominantly easy climbs, yellow is moderates, and red is difficult. This can help people decide on areas that will be appropriate to
their levels</p>
