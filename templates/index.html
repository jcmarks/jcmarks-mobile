	<h1>Data Pipeline Project Mobile Byte</h1>
        <p>Comparing my phone usage to others.</p>
      </div>
      
  <h2>Research Questions and Data Collection</h2>
  <div> 
  <p>In this Byte, I was interested in doing a comparison of my phone usage to several other usage studies completed, as reported in the
  <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2630000/2628380/p243-banovic.pdf?ip=128.237.205.104&id=2628380&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=A792924B58C015C1%2E5A12BE0369099858%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&CFID=730334629&CFTOKEN=51578275&__acm__=1487631640_fe9afa66932f221bd08d78e476faca55">ProactiveTasks</a> paper. When we read this paper early in the term, I was struck by the frequency of short interactions with the phone. One 
  limitation we had discussed about this paper is the small number of samples they used, 10 people. I was interested in learning whether the
  trends identified in that sample set would generalize to the ways that I interact with my phone.</p>
  <p>To answer whether my phone usage fits within the sample collected for the InteractiveTasks paper, I had to look at the duration and frequency
  of interactions with my phone. AWARE collected time and duration information for times that my screen was on and off, and I used that data to 
  perform the bulk of my analysis.</p>
  <p>Particular questions I was interested in answering were the following:</p>
  </div>
<!-- 
  <h2>Query Results</h2>
   <ul>
   {% for item in queries %}
   <li>Query: {{item.query}}<br>
       {% for row in item.results %}
          {{row}}<br>
       {% endfor %}
   </li>
   {% endfor %}
   </ul>
   -->
   
   <h2>Data Usage</h2>
   <p>To begin my comparison, I plotted the frequency of different types of interactions. Banovic et al. report a histogram, shown here, that 
   shows high frequency of phone usage in short durations, with diminishing use at higher lengths of time. My data were compared to these,
   except that the time scale was extended up to 10 minutes+ of interaction time, rather than 4 minutes.</p>

   <img src="templates/histogram.png" alt="My Histogram" style="width:550px;height:350px;">
   <p style="clear: both;">
   <p>The graphs exhibit a similar shapes on the low interaction time end. There are a high number of interactions of a very shot duration, with
   decreasing frequency. Also similarly, my data exhibit a natural break, though this occurs around 65 rather than around 60 seconds as reported in
   the referenced paper. Of note, my personal data show a spike for interactions of length greater than 10 minutes that was not present in the
   comparative figure. It appears that I might be using my phone in a way that is atypical of average users.</p>
   <p>To take a deeper consideration of the differences in the distributions, I compared the types of uses as presented in the ProactiveTasks paper.</p>
	<p>Falaki et al. (2010) found that mobile data usage varies dramatically, with mean usage time between 10 and 250 seconds. My usage falls within that,
	with a mean usage time of 220 seconds.</p>
	<p>Yan et al. (2012) found that 50% of the interactions people have with their phones are less than 30 seconds, and 90% of the interactions are
	less than 4 minutes long. I found that only 32% of my interactions were less than 30 seconds long, 90.6% of my interactions were under four minutes.</p>
	<p>Finally, I compared my data to the terms presented in the ProactiveTasks paper, with the discussion of glance, review, and engage sessions. This
	paper found the following:</p>
	<ul style="float: left; min-width: 500px;">
	<li>Glance median device usage: 46.6%</li>
	<li>Review median device usage: 24.6%</li>
	<li>Engage median device usage: 22.1%</li>
	</ul>

   	<img src="templates/usage_types.png" alt="My Usage Types" style="float: left;width:200px;height:200px;">
 <p style="clear: both;">
   <p>As seen in my distribution, we see the heavy prevalence of these long-duration interactions: approximately 55% of my interactions are longer
   than a minute in duration. The combination of all these long interactions led to a grand total of 30 hours on my phone through the course of this study.</p>
   
   <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
   <p>To rationalize why I was exhibiting so much more long-duration phone usage than the users reported in the ProactiveTasks work, I looked at
   further analysis of the phone usage over the different days. I considered both total usage time and mean usage time for each day of the study;
   mean time on the phone is shown here.</p>
   	<img src="templates/mean usage time.png" alt="My Mean Usage per Day" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
   <p>A meta-analysis of my patterns during this study duration was illuminating to determine some of the source of the longer phone use. I have signed
   up for the Pittsburgh Marathon, and as such, have been running frequently. During these runs, I have been using my phone as a stopwatch for time trials.
   Each of these time trials lasts 10 to 30 minutes, during which I keep the phone screen on so I can easily glance at it to observe when the time trial 
   is complete. This figure shows the running days, in black, mapped onto the mean phone usage.</p>
   	<img src="templates/runs.png" alt="My Runs" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
	<p>Although this does not account for all the peaks in mean phone usage times, a few things are apparent. First, at least half of the days were running
	days, which I predict to drive my phone usage up. Second, there is some correlation between the peak days and the high mean usage times: although
	I did not perform a rigorous comparison, I can visually observe that many of the days have high .</p>
	<p>An additional consideration into why my data might not match that of the ProactiveTask findings is that they attributed many of the "glance" interactions
	to be checking the phone for a time. I wear a wristwatch, so my actions that might be classified as "glancing" are sent to a different data source.</p>
	
	<h2>Future Work</h2>
	<p>I am interested in the possibility of continuing to pursue the question of why my distribution is so heavily weighted towards longer durations.
	The next analysis I would complete is a study of the correlation of usage time and activity: to see whether my prediction that I use my phone
	a lot while I run is true, or if I am using more when I am sedentary. I am also intrigued by which applications are demanding my time, to test
	my prediction that the stopwatch app is driving my long usage durations.</p>
	<p>Finally, it may be interesting to conduct an experiment to notice how my behavior changes depending on whether or not I am wearing a wristwatch.</p>
